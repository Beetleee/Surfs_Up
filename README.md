# Module 9 : Surfs Up Weather Analysis

### by Terra Lasho

## Project Overview

I am tasked to analyze specific dates for weather in Hawaii as my Client wants to open a surf and ice cream shop. For this, I focused on extracting the weather temperature in June and December, and executing statistics between the two periods for the Client to ponder while thinking of when to open his shop.

## Results

### Deliverable #1: working query of June's temperature statistics over time

### Deliverable #2: working query of Decemberâ€™s temperature statistics over time

### Deliverable #3: These two tables tell us about the differing weather patterns for the two monthly periods. Some takeaways:
- 1) Avg temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees, which reflects not a big change in temperature
- 2) Maximum temperatures of 85 (in June) and 83 (in December) are also similar.
- 3) Minimum temperature of 64 (in June) 56 (in December) have the biggest difference, and may effect decisions to eat ice cream and/or surf. However, there is apt to be fluctuations in temperatures in December reflected in the STD Dev (3.74 in December)-so maybe there is still a window for surf & ice cream.

## Summary
Overall, this analysis is a visual representation of the weather temperature fluctuations for June and December in Hawaii.  in December and June are historically very similar, although December has a wider range of results, with its high being close to June's but its low well below June's.  
Additional queries that could be run include: Precipitation difference between June and December as well as a look at variances in different GPS locations in the area (beach vs inland?), as we might see higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels.
